## üß¨ What is CelFlow?

CelFlow represents a new paradigm in personal AI - instead of using pre-built assistants, it grows its own agents based on your actual usage patterns. Think of it as an AI ecosystem that evolves alongside your digital life.

### Key Features

- **Silent Learning**: Monitors your system activity without interruption
- **Agent Evolution**: Develops specialized AI agents based on your patterns  
- **Privacy-First**: All processing happens locally on your machine
- **Adaptive Intelligence**: Continuously learns and improves over time
- **Seamless Integration**: Works invisibly in the background

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- macOS 10.15+ (Catalina or later)
- Python 3.9+
- 4GB+ RAM recommended
- Accessibility permissions (for system monitoring)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/celflow/celflow.git
   cd celflow
   ```

2. **Set up the environment**
   ```bash
   # Create virtual environment
   python3 -m venv environments/celflow_env
   source environments/celflow_env/bin/activate
   
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r backend/requirements/base.txt
   ```

3. **Grant permissions**
   - Go to System Preferences ‚Üí Security & Privacy ‚Üí Privacy
   - Enable "Accessibility" for Terminal or your IDE
   - Enable "Full Disk Access" if prompted

4. **Start CelFlow**
   ```bash
   ./launch_celflow.sh start
   ```

## üìä System Architecture

CelFlow consists of several integrated components:

- **Event Capture**: Monitors system events and user interactions
- **Embryo Pool**: Manages developing agent patterns
- **Central AI Brain**: Coordinates learning and decision-making
- **Agent Manager**: Handles agent lifecycle and specialization
- **System Tray**: Provides user interface and controls

## üéØ How It Works

1. **Observation Phase**: CelFlow silently monitors your digital activities
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies recurring patterns in your behavior
3. **Embryo Development**: Creates potential agents based on detected patterns
4. **Agent Birth**: Specialized agents emerge when patterns reach maturity
5. **Continuous Evolution**: Agents adapt and improve based on feedback

## üß† AI Lambda Capability

CelFlow's AI can now write and execute custom Python code on-demand, similar to AWS Lambda but running locally:

### When AI Uses Code Execution

The AI automatically recognizes when to use code execution for:
- Complex mathematical calculations (prime numbers, Fibonacci, factorials)
- Data processing and transformation
- Custom algorithm implementation
- Statistical analysis and machine learning
- Dynamic visualization generation

### Example Interactions

**User**: "Calculate the first 20 prime numbers"
**AI**: *Writes and executes code, returns actual results*

**User**: "Analyze this CSV file and show me correlations"
**AI**: *Processes data with pandas, generates visualization*

**User**: "Create a custom sorting algorithm for my specific needs"
**AI**: *Implements and tests the algorithm in real-time*

### Security Features

- AST-based code validation prevents dangerous operations
- Resource limits (memory and execution time)
- Sandboxed execution environment
- Whitelisted imports only
- No file system or network access

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Start the system
./launch_celflow.sh start

# Check status
./launch_celflow.sh status

# Stop the system
./launch_celflow.sh stop

# Restart everything
./launch_celflow.sh restart

# View logs
