### ðŸ›  Core Components

#### Tool System (`backend/app/ai/enhanced_tool_system.py`)

- Dynamic tool registry with type-safe parameter validation
- Category-based tool organization (web_search, code_execution, etc.)
- Performance monitoring and execution statistics
- Sandboxed execution environment with comprehensive error handling

#### Workflow Engine (`backend/app/ai/enhanced_agent_workflow.py`)

- Automatic task decomposition into executable steps
- Dependency management and step execution ordering
- Dynamic workflow adaptation based on results
- Intelligent result synthesis and context preservation

#### Enhanced User Interface Agent (`backend/app/ai/enhanced_user_interface_agent.py`)

- Smart context analysis to determine tool requirements
- User pattern learning and preference adaptation
- Graceful fallback mechanisms for robust operation
- Voice command support and proactive assistance

### ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture

#### Agent Capabilities

- **Model**: Gemma 3:4B via Ollama integration
- **Tool Calling**: JSON-based structured responses with error recovery
- **Web Search**: DuckDuckGo instant answers with HTML scraping fallback
- **Code Execution**: Whitelisted algorithms with mandatory visualization
- **Workflow Management**: Multi-step task orchestration with state management

#### Integration Layer

- **Backward Compatibility**: Seamless integration with existing CentralAIBrain
- **Feature Detection**: Automatic capability detection and graceful degradation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery and user feedback
- **Performance Monitoring**: Detailed logging and execution metrics

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+
- Ollama with Gemma 3:4B model
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone and Setup Environment**

```bash
git clone <repository-url> alims
cd alims
python -m venv alims_env
source alims_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: alims_env\Scripts\activate
```

2. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r backend/requirements/base.txt
pip install -r backend/requirements/clustering.txt
pip install -r backend/requirements/visual.txt
```

3. **Configure Ollama**

```bash
ollama pull gemma2:27b  # or gemma2:9b for faster performance
```

4. **Launch ALIMS**

```bash
./launch_alims.sh
```

### Usage Examples

#### Web Search Integration

```python
# The agent automatically uses web search for informational queries
user: "What are the latest developments in quantum computing?"
# Agent will search the web and provide comprehensive, up-to-date information
```

#### Code Execution with Visualization

```python
# Safe code execution with mandatory visual output
user: "Generate a visualization of prime numbers up to 100"
# Agent will execute safe Python code and create a matplotlib visualization
```

#### Multi-step Workflow

```python
# Complex task decomposition
user: "Research the latest AI trends and create a summary with charts"
# Agent will: 1) Search web for AI trends, 2) Analyze data, 3) Create visualizations
```

## Configuration
