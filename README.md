# SelFlow - Self-Evolving AI Operating System Layer

**The first AI that creates itself - one agent at a time.**

SelFlow is a revolutionary AI operating system layer that starts with simple pattern-detecting "embryos" and evolves into a personalized ecosystem of specialized AI agents through natural selection and biological-inspired evolution.

## 🧬 The Vision

Imagine an AI system that:
- **Observes silently** - Learning your patterns without interruption
- **Evolves naturally** - Agents literally create themselves from your data
- **Specializes uniquely** - Each installation becomes unique to its user
- **Grows organically** - From 15 embryos to a full agent ecosystem

## 🚀 Current Status: Phase 1 - The Embryo Pool

We've successfully implemented the foundational **Embryo Pool** system:

✅ **15 Agent Embryos** - Competing neural networks detecting patterns  
✅ **Natural Selection** - Survival of the fittest pattern detectors  
✅ **Privacy-First Design** - All processing happens locally  
✅ **macOS Integration** - Native system tray with evolving interface  
✅ **Pattern Detection** - Real neural networks learning user behavior  

### Test Results
```
🧬 5 active embryos observing
📊 50 events processed successfully
🎯 Specializations emerging: file_operations
🔒 Privacy filters active
✅ All systems operational
```

## 🎭 The Agent Birth Process

**Phase 1: Silent Observer (Current)**
- 15 embryos compete to detect patterns
- Each embryo has a 1M parameter neural network
- Natural selection culls weak performers
- Best embryos fill their 16MB data buffers

**Phase 2: Agent Creation (Next)**
- Birth-ready embryos trigger the Agent Creator AI
- SmolLM-1.7B analyzes patterns and creates specialized agents
- Each agent gets a unique personality and capabilities
- First agent introduces itself to the user

**Phase 3: Ecosystem Growth**
- Agents coordinate and communicate
- Voice interface becomes available
- Proactive assistance emerges
- System becomes indispensable

## 🏁 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- macOS (tested on macOS 14.3+)
- Python 3.8+
- 4GB RAM, 10GB storage

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/bioduds/selflow.git
cd selflow

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv selflow_env
source selflow_env/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install torch numpy --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

# Test the embryo pool
python test_embryo_pool.py
```

### Expected Output
```
🧬 Starting SelFlow Embryo Pool Test...
📊 Pool status: 5 active embryos, 50 events processed
✅ Embryo Pool Test Completed Successfully!
```

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. Embryo Competition
Each of the 15 embryos is a small neural network (1M parameters) that:
- Observes system events (file operations, app launches, etc.)
- Learns to detect specific patterns
- Competes with other embryos for survival
- Specializes in different domains (development, communication, creative work, etc.)

### 2. Natural Selection
- Embryos with low fitness scores are culled
- New embryos are spawned to maintain population
- Only the best pattern detectors survive
- Specialization emerges through competition

### 3. Agent Birth
When an embryo fills its 16MB data buffer:
- Agent Creator AI analyzes the embryo's patterns
- Creates a specialized agent with unique personality
- Agent introduces itself and begins helping
- Ecosystem grows more capable over time

## 🛡️ Privacy & Security

**Privacy-First Design:**
- All processing happens locally on your machine
- Sensitive data (passwords, PII) filtered in real-time
- User data never leaves your computer
- Encrypted storage for all pattern data
- Granular privacy controls

**What We Filter:**
- Passwords and API keys
- Credit card numbers
- Personal information (emails, phones)
- Banking and financial applications
- Any app marked as "sensitive"
