## üß¨ What is CelFlow?

CelFlow represents a new paradigm in personal AI - instead of using pre-built assistants, it grows its own agents based on your actual usage patterns. Think of it as an AI ecosystem that evolves alongside your digital life.

### Key Features

- **Silent Learning**: Monitors your system activity without interruption
- **Agent Evolution**: Develops specialized AI agents based on your patterns  
- **Privacy-First**: All processing happens locally on your machine
- **Adaptive Intelligence**: Continuously learns and improves over time
- **Seamless Integration**: Works invisibly in the background

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- macOS 10.15+ (Catalina or later)
- Python 3.9+
- 4GB+ RAM recommended
- Accessibility permissions (for system monitoring)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/celflow/celflow.git
   cd celflow
   ```

2. **Set up the environment**
   ```bash
   # Create virtual environment
   python3 -m venv environments/celflow_env
   source environments/celflow_env/bin/activate
   
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r backend/requirements/base.txt
   ```

3. **Grant permissions**
   - Go to System Preferences ‚Üí Security & Privacy ‚Üí Privacy
   - Enable "Accessibility" for Terminal or your IDE
   - Enable "Full Disk Access" if prompted

4. **Start CelFlow**
   ```bash
   ./launch_celflow.sh start
   ```

## üìä System Architecture

CelFlow consists of several integrated components:

- **Event Capture**: Monitors system events and user interactions
- **Embryo Pool**: Manages developing agent patterns
- **Central AI Brain**: Coordinates learning and decision-making
- **Agent Manager**: Handles agent lifecycle and specialization
- **System Tray**: Provides user interface and controls

## üéØ How It Works

1. **Observation Phase**: CelFlow silently monitors your digital activities
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies recurring patterns in your behavior
3. **Embryo Development**: Creates potential agents based on detected patterns
4. **Agent Birth**: Specialized agents emerge when patterns reach maturity
5. **Continuous Evolution**: Agents adapt and improve based on feedback

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Start the system
./launch_celflow.sh start

# Check status
./launch_celflow.sh status

# Stop the system
./launch_celflow.sh stop

# Restart everything
./launch_celflow.sh restart

# View logs
./launch_celflow.sh logs
```

### System Tray

CelFlow runs in your system tray with a üß¨ icon. Right-click to access:

- System status and statistics
- Agent management controls
- Learning toggle (pause/resume)
- Configuration options
- Logs and diagnostics

### Dashboard

Access the web dashboard at `http://localhost:8080` to view:

- Real-time system activity
- Agent development progress
- Pattern evolution graphs
- System performance metrics

## üîß Configuration

CelFlow can be configured through YAML files in the `config/` directory:

- `default.yaml`: Core system settings
- `ai_config.yaml`: AI model and learning parameters
- `emergent_agents.yaml`: Agent templates and evolution rules

## üìà Development Phases

CelFlow development follows a structured approach:

### Phase 1: Foundation ‚úÖ
- Event capture system
- Basic pattern detection
- Data persistence
- System tray integration

### Phase 2: Intelligence üîÑ
- Central AI brain
- Advanced pattern recognition
- Embryo development system
- Agent orchestration

### Phase 3: Evolution üìã
- Agent birth and specialization
- Meta-learning capabilities
- Advanced user interaction
- Performance optimization

## üîí Privacy & Security

CelFlow is designed with privacy as a core principle:

- **Local Processing**: All AI processing happens on your device
- **No Data Transmission**: Your data never leaves your machine
- **Sensitive Content Filtering**: Automatically excludes passwords, financial data
- **Granular Controls**: Fine-tune what gets monitored
- **Transparent Operation**: Full visibility into system activities
