# Frontend Docker Connectivity - Fix Summary

## Problem
The ALIMS frontend chat was stuck on "Connecting..." because the main interface was moved to Docker, but the Tauri backend was still trying to execute Python scripts directly instead of making HTTP API calls.

## Solution Applied
1. **Updated Tauri Backend** (`frontend/desktop/src-tauri/src/lib.rs`):
   - Added `reqwest` and `tokio` dependencies for HTTP requests
   - Modified `start_chat_session()` to call `POST /api/v1/interface/conversations/start`
   - Modified `send_chat_message()` to call `POST /api/v1/interface/conversations/message`
   - Modified `get_chat_history()` to call `GET /api/v1/interface/conversations/{id}/messages`
   - Set backend URL to `http://localhost:8003` (Docker container)

2. **Updated Dependencies** (`frontend/desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`):
   - Added `reqwest = { version = "0.12", features = ["json"] }`
   - Added `tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }`

3. **Verified Backend Connectivity**:
   - Created test script (`test_frontend_connectivity.py`)
   - Confirmed all API endpoints work correctly
   - Verified AI agent responses and memory system

## Test Results
✅ Health endpoint: Working
✅ Conversation start: Working
✅ Message sending: Working
✅ AI responses: Working
✅ Memory system: Working

## Current Status
- **Tauri Application**: ✅ Compiled and running
- **Backend API**: ✅ Fully functional in Docker
- **Frontend**: Ready for testing

## Next Steps
1. **Test the Chat UI**: Open the Tauri application and try the chat interface
2. **Verify End-to-End**: Send messages and confirm AI responses appear
3. **Test Memory System**: Verify conversation context is maintained

## Technical Changes Made

### Tauri Backend Communication Flow (Before):
```
Frontend → Tauri Rust → Execute Python Scripts → Response
```

### Tauri Backend Communication Flow (After):
```
Frontend → Tauri Rust → HTTP Request to Docker → Response
```

### API Endpoints Used:
- `POST http://localhost:8003/api/v1/interface/conversations/start`
- `POST http://localhost:8003/api/v1/interface/conversations/message`
- `GET http://localhost:8003/api/v1/interface/conversations/{id}/messages`

## Expected Behavior
- Chat interface should show "Ready" instead of "Connecting..."
- Messages sent should get AI responses from Llama 3.2
- Conversation context should be maintained through memory system
- Sample registration and lab operations should work as expected

## If Issues Persist
1. Check Docker containers are running: `docker ps`
2. Verify main-interface health: `curl http://localhost:8003/health`
3. Check browser console for frontend errors
4. Restart Tauri development server: `npm run tauri dev`
