Im interested in developing a system that uses very small models that the user can train inside their environments. For a short amount of time the system will capture information from the user (all it can get into, screens, audio, small files, not big ones...) and count the size of it. once it reaches close to the limit for training the little model, it will start a round of training it. While it trains the model it is already gathering info for the next model. System will keep doing it until a certain limit. As the models finish training, they become available for usage and user can start directing work into them and evaluating their results. The system will keep improving itself so that the models that perform better are selected and the models that perform poorly are substituted by new ones continuously created.

Below is a step-by-step blueprint for the continual-training system you described, followed by concrete technology suggestions and practical tips drawn from the latest research and tooling.

1. High-Level Lifecycle
Phase	Purpose	Typical Duration	Key Services
A. Capture & Buffer	Collect small, privacy-scoped artifacts (screen text snippets, short audio transcripts, configuration files, etc.). Stop when the byte budget nears a preset cap (e.g. 64 MB).	Seconds → minutes	Capture Daemon, Rolling Buffer
B. Pre-flight Prep	Deduplicate, redact PII, tokenize / feature-extract, and write a manifest of sample sizes so the trainer knows the memory cost up-front.	Seconds	Data Cleaner, Feature Encoder
C. Async Mini-Training	Fine-tune or train a Tiny Model while Capture continues filling the next buffer. Use LoRA/QLoRA-style adapters or lightweight CNN/RNN heads so the update fits in device RAM/VRAM.	Minutes (<= 10 on laptop-class GPU; <= 30 on CPU)	Trainer Worker
D. Evaluation & Scoring	Auto-test on a held-out slice + realtime user feedback signals (click-through, “was this helpful?”). Compute a rolling score.	Milliseconds per inference + background aggregation	Evaluator, Metric Store
E. Model Pool Management	Keep the top k models (e.g. k = 5). Periodically prune the tail, freeing disk & RAM, and promote newly-trained candidates.	Continuous	Registry, Bandit Selector

Concurrency rule of thumb: one capture buffer → one train job. You never stall data capture because training happens in a separate process/GPU queue.

2. Component-by-Component Details
2.1 Capture Daemon
Runs with least privileges; respects OS sandbox rules.

Modular collectors (screen → OCR, mic → ASR, file watcher) publish small chunks (≤ 256 kB) to a local Rolling Buffer (a ring database or Redis capped stream).

Maintains a running byte counter; triggers “Training Ready” event at ~90 % of byte budget.

2.2 Data Cleaner & Encoder
Masks e-mails, IDs, credit cards (RegEx & NER).

Converts raw text/audio to tokens or embeddings before storage to cut footprint further.

Writes manifest.json: {samples: N, tokens: T, bytes: B} — used to verify the next phase will fit.

2.3 Trainer Worker
Model family: choose a sub-1 B-parameter backbone that supports fast adapter updates — e.g. Phi-3-mini, Mistral-tiny, Gemma 2B-Instruct or even ≤ 128-dim CNN for vision tasks.

Technique: 4-bit QLoRA or LoRA + Flash-Attention; update only <1 % of parameters to keep VRAM ≤ 4 GB. 
philschmid.de

Scheduling: nice-level or OS background QoS so user tasks stay responsive.

Stores artifacts in Model Registry (see below) with metadata {model_id, parent, data_hash, score=0}.

2.4 Evaluator & Metric Store
Offline unit tests + online implicit feedback:

latency (ms/inference),

accuracy/rouge/wer where applicable,

user-click “thumbs-up”.

Scores fed to a multi-armed-bandit selector (ε-greedy or UCB) that routes real queries to the current best-performing model but still explores newcomers ~10 % of the time.

2.5 Model Registry & Bandit Selector
Lightweight SQLite or DuckDB file plus symlink directory:

/models/best → symlink to top1,

/models/candidate_* for the rest.

Registry enforces k-cap: oldest low-scorers are deleted when len(models) > k.

3. Technology Stack (2025–Vintage)
Need	Recommended Tooling	Why
On-device fine-tune	Hugging Face PEFT + QLoRA	Mature API, supports 4-bit adapters, CPU fallbacks. 
philschmid.de
Unified train-serve	Ollama >= 0.6	Can accept a LoRA and immediately expose an HTTP/GRPC endpoint; zero-config serving. 
union.ai
Streaming buffer	Redis Stream (capped)	Handles bursty writes, supports consumer groups for trainer/evaluator.
Tiny vision/audio models	EdgeImpulse SDK or TFLite-Micro	Designed for kilobyte-scale models on MCU / ARM.
Incremental learning adapters	LODAP (EIM adapters) for CNNs on embedded devices. 
arxiv.org
Privacy auditing	Open-Source Data Profiler (ODP)	Scans for PII, GDPR labels.
Metric store	Prometheus + SQLite	Prometheus for realtime dashboards; SQLite for model metadata.

5. Replacement & Self-Improvement Policy
Exploit: Route 90 % of traffic to current best model.

Explore: Randomly sample the rest (10 %).
If a candidate beats the incumbent on moving average × significance test, promote it.

Cull: When len(pool) > k, drop the worst and oldest to avoid over-fitting to stale data.

Adaptive Budget: If average model quality stagnates, increase per-batch data cap; if latency spikes, decrease.

6. Practical Tips & Pitfalls
Cold start: Ship a zero-shot base checkpoint so the first model is usable while training #1.

Resource guardrails: Detect AC power & CPU/GPU idleness before launching heavy training to avoid draining laptop battery.

Security: Run Trainer in a sandbox (Docker or macOS sandbox-exec) so malicious files cannot escalate.

Dataset drift: Keep a shadow buffer of the last N MB to mix with new data, giving continuity and preventing catastrophic forgetting.

User controls: Expose sliders for privacy scope and max device usage %; show a “Currently Training” toast with ETA.

Closing Thoughts
With modern adapter-based fine-tuning techniques (QLoRA, LoRA) and tools like Ollama that collapse training and serving into a single CLI, it’s now practical to run the entire cycle—capture → fine-tune → serve → evaluate → replace—on a single workstation or even a high-end phone. Following the modular pipeline above gives you:

Continuous improvement without user-perceived downtime,

Strict caps on storage and compute,

Privacy-first local processing,

A natural evolutionary pressure that keeps only the best mini-models alive.

Happy building!
