Neural Training → Agent Birth → Performance Monitoring → 
Real-time Visualization
```

## 🎨 Customization

### Embryo Development Speed
Adjust development speed in `visual_meta_learning.py`:
```python
progress_increment = {
    EmbryoStage.CONCEPTION: 0.002,    # Slower
    EmbryoStage.TRAINING: 0.012,      # Faster
}
```

### Dashboard Styling
Modify `dashboard.html` CSS for custom themes:
```css
.card {
    background: your-custom-gradient;
    border-radius: your-preferred-radius;
}
```

### Notification Preferences
Configure notifications in the tray settings or modify the notification logic in the launcher.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Tray Interface Not Appearing (macOS)
```bash
pip install rumps
# Ensure you're running on macOS
```

#### Dashboard Not Loading
- Check if port 8080 is available
- Look for error messages in the console
- Try accessing http://localhost:8080 directly

#### WebSocket Connection Failed
- Firewall might be blocking connections
- Try restarting the system
- Check browser console for errors

#### No Embryos Appearing
- System needs time to collect sufficient data
- Check that events are being captured in `data/events.db`
- Patterns need to reach confidence threshold

### Debug Mode
Run with debug logging:
```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python -c "
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
from run_visual_celflow import main
main()
"
```
