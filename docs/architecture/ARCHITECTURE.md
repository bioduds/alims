# CelFlow: AI Operating System Layer

## Vision Statement
CelFlow is an AI-powered operational layer that sits on top of macOS, gradually learning to automate and control every aspect of your computing experience through natural language and intelligent automation.

## Core Philosophy
- **Voice-First Computing**: Replace mouse/keyboard with natural speech
- **Progressive Learning**: System becomes more capable over time
- **Workflow Automation**: Learn and replicate complex multi-step tasks
- **Universal Control**: Interface with any application or system function
- **Privacy-First**: All learning and processing happens locally

- **Workflow Library**: Store and organize learned automations
- **Context Memory**: Remember conversation and action history

## Use Cases & Progression

### **Phase 1: Basic Voice Control**
- "Open Spotify and play my Focus playlist"
- "Show me last week's emails from John"
- "Create a new document and start taking notes"
- "Schedule a meeting for tomorrow at 2 PM"

### **Phase 2: Workflow Automation**
- "Prepare my daily standup report" (opens tools, gathers data, formats)
- "Process these invoices" (extract data, organize, send to accounting)
- "Research this topic and create a summary" (web search, analysis, doc creation)
- "Backup my project files to cloud storage"

### **Phase 3: Predictive Assistance**
- Automatically organize downloads into appropriate folders
- Suggest actions based on calendar events
- Proactively prepare documents for upcoming meetings
- Monitor and optimize system performance

### **Phase 4: Complete Automation**
- Handle entire workflows with minimal input
- Intelligent task scheduling and prioritization
- Cross-application data synchronization
- Predictive problem solving

## Technical Implementation

### **System Integration APIs**
- **macOS Accessibility**: Screen readers, UI automation
- **AppleScript/JXA**: Native app control and automation
- **System Events**: File system, process management
- **Screen Capture**: Real-time screen analysis
- **Audio/Speech**: Continuous listening and TTS

### **AI Model Stack**
- **Command Understanding**: SmolLM-1.7B fine-tuned for system commands
- **Vision Processing**: Lightweight models for screen understanding
- **Workflow Learning**: Specialized models for pattern recognition
- **Action Planning**: Models that can plan multi-step automations

### **Data Collection & Learning**
- **Screen Recording**: Capture user workflows (with permission)
- **Command History**: Track successful voice commands
- **App Usage Patterns**: Learn frequently used features
- **Error Correction**: Learn from failed automations

## Privacy & Security

### **Data Principles**
- **Local Processing**: All AI processing happens on-device
- **User Control**: Complete transparency and control over data
- **Encrypted Storage**: All user data encrypted locally
- **No Cloud Dependencies**: System works entirely offline

### **Permission Model**
- **Granular Controls**: User chooses what CelFlow can access
- **Audit Trail**: Complete log of all system actions
- **Revocable Access**: Easy to disable any automation
- **Sandbox Execution**: Safe execution of learned automations

## Distribution Strategy

### **Installation & Setup**
- **Single App Bundle**: Complete system in one macOS app
- **Guided Onboarding**: Progressive permission requests
- **Training Mode**: Safe environment to learn initial commands
- **Import/Export**: Share workflows between users (optional)

### **Monetization**
- **Freemium Model**: Basic voice control free, advanced automation paid
- **Enterprise License**: Teams and organizations
- **Workflow Marketplace**: Users can share/sell automation templates
- **Professional Services**: Custom automation development
