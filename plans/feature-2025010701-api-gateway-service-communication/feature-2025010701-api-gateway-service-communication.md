# Feature: API Gateway Service Communication

## Overview

This feature implements the core API Gateway for ALIMS microservices architecture, handling request routing, load balancing, circuit breakers, and service discovery with formal correctness guarantees.

## Scope

### Components Included
- **API Gateway Router**: Routes requests to appropriate backend services
- **Service Discovery**: Maintains registry of available services
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevents cascade failures
- **Load Balancer**: Distributes requests across service instances
- **Request/Response Pipeline**: Handles authentication, transformation, and logging

### Critical Properties to Verify
1. **Correctness**: Requests always route to available services
2. **Availability**: System remains responsive during service failures
3. **Consistency**: Service registry accurately reflects service states
4. **Deadlock Freedom**: No circular dependencies in request processing
5. **Circuit Breaker Safety**: Prevents overwhelming failing services

## Architecture

```
Client Request → API Gateway → [Load Balancer] → Backend Service
                     ↓
              [Circuit Breaker]
                     ↓
              [Service Discovery]
```

### State Variables
- `services`: Set of registered services and their states
- `requests`: Queue of incoming client requests
- `routing_table`: Mapping from API paths to services
- `circuit_states`: Circuit breaker states per service
- `service_health`: Health status of each service instance

### Key Operations
1. `RegisterService`: Add new service to registry
2. `RouteRequest`: Route client request to appropriate service
3. `UpdateHealth`: Update service health status
4. `TriggerCircuitBreaker`: Open circuit for failing service
5. `ProcessResponse`: Handle service response and update metrics

## TLA+ Specification Goals

### Safety Properties
- **Routing Correctness**: Every request routes to a healthy service or returns an error
- **Circuit Breaker Safety**: Circuit breaker prevents requests to unhealthy services
- **Service Registry Consistency**: Service states accurately reflect reality
- **No Request Loss**: Requests are either processed or explicitly rejected

### Liveness Properties
- **Progress**: Eventually, healthy services process requests
- **Recovery**: Failed services eventually recover and accept requests
- **Circuit Breaker Recovery**: Circuits eventually close when services recover

### Invariants
- At most one request processed per service instance at a time (if configured)
- Circuit breaker state transitions follow valid state machine
- Service registry maintains valid service states
- Request queue has bounded size

## Implementation Plan

1. **TLA+ Specification** (This step)
2. **TLC Model Checking** (Validate with small parameters)
3. **Human Review** (Translate model to natural language)
4. **Test Suite** (Full coverage tests matching TLA+ properties)
5. **Implementation** (FastAPI-based API Gateway)
6. **PredicateLogic Integration** (Intelligent routing decisions)
7. **Validation** (Verify implementation matches specification)

## Success Criteria

- TLC model checker passes with no safety violations
- All temporal properties verified within bounds
- Circuit breaker behavior formally verified
- Load balancing fairness properties proven
- Implementation passes all property-based tests derived from TLA+ spec

## Risk Mitigation

- **State Space Explosion**: Use symmetry sets for identical service instances
- **Complex Routing Logic**: Abstract routing decisions to simple predicates
- **Performance Concerns**: Model logical behavior, not performance metrics
- **Integration Complexity**: Focus on API Gateway boundaries, abstract service internals
