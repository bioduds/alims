SPECIFICATION Spec

\* Model configuration for API Gateway specification  
\* This configuration defines the constants and properties to check

CONSTANTS
    \* Define concrete values for the specification constants
    Services = {"predicate_logic", "data_service", "workflow_service"}
    MaxRequests = 3
    CircuitThreshold = 2
    MaxServiceLoad = 2

\* Invariants to check (safety properties)
INVARIANTS
    TypeInvariant
    NoRoutingToFailedServices
    CircuitBreakerConsistency
    LoadBalancingFairness
    ServiceDiscoveryAccuracy
    CapacityLimits

\* Properties to check (liveness - commented out for initial runs due to state explosion)
\* PROPERTIES
\*     RequestProgress
\*     CircuitBreakerRecovery

\* State constraints to bound the model
CONSTRAINT
    StateConstraint

\* Symmetry to reduce state space (commented out for initial run)
\* SYMMETRY Services
