# API Gateway Service Communication - Test Coverage Plan

## üéØ **Test Strategy Based on TLA+ Specification**

### **Phase 1: Property-Based Test Coverage**

Following the validated TLA+ specification, we need comprehensive tests that verify all proven safety properties in the actual implementation.

#### **1. Core Safety Property Tests**

##### **A. Target Service Enforcement Tests**
```python
class TestTargetServiceEnforcement:
    """Verify requests are only routed to their intended target service"""
    
    def test_no_cross_service_routing(self):
        # Test: Request for ServiceA never goes to ServiceB
        pass
    
    def test_service_specific_routing(self):
        # Test: Each service type gets correct requests
        pass
    
    def test_load_balancing_within_service(self):
        # Test: Load balancing only within service instances
        pass
```

##### **B. Circuit Breaker Property Tests**
```python
class TestCircuitBreakerProperties:
    """Verify circuit breaker state machine correctness"""
    
    def test_failure_threshold_triggers_open(self):
        # Test: CircuitThreshold failures ‚Üí OPEN state
        pass
    
    def test_recovery_testing_half_open(self):
        # Test: OPEN ‚Üí HALF_OPEN ‚Üí CLOSED/OPEN
        pass
    
    def test_failed_service_isolation(self):
        # Test: No routing to services with OPEN circuit breakers
        pass
```

##### **C. Service Health Management Tests**
```python
class TestServiceHealthManagement:
    """Verify service health state transitions"""
    
    def test_health_state_transitions(self):
        # Test: UNKNOWN ‚Üí HEALTHY ‚Üí DEGRADED ‚Üí FAILED
        pass
    
    def test_routing_respects_health_status(self):
        # Test: Only route to HEALTHY/DEGRADED services
        pass
    
    def test_service_recovery_scenarios(self):
        # Test: Service recovery and health restoration
        pass
```

##### **D. Capacity Management Tests**
```python
class TestCapacityManagement:
    """Verify load and capacity limit enforcement"""
    
    def test_service_load_limits(self):
        # Test: MaxServiceLoad enforcement
        pass
    
    def test_system_request_limits(self):
        # Test: MaxRequests system-wide limit
        pass
    
    def test_load_tracking_accuracy(self):
        # Test: Load increment/decrement correctness
        pass
```

### **Phase 2: State Machine Test Coverage**

#### **Request Lifecycle Tests**
```python
class TestRequestLifecycle:
    """Verify complete request processing flow"""
    
    def test_pending_to_routed_transition(self):
        # Test: PENDING ‚Üí ROUTED with valid service
        pass
    
    def test_routed_to_completed_success(self):
        # Test: ROUTED ‚Üí COMPLETED success path
        pass
    
    def test_routed_to_failed_error(self):
        # Test: ROUTED ‚Üí FAILED error handling
        pass
    
    def test_request_integrity_maintained(self):
        # Test: Request structure preserved throughout
        pass
```

### **Phase 3: Integration Test Coverage**

#### **End-to-End Scenarios**
```python
class TestAPIGatewayIntegration:
    """Full system integration tests"""
    
    def test_multi_service_environment(self):
        # Test: Multiple services with different health states
        pass
    
    def test_concurrent_request_processing(self):
        # Test: Multiple requests processed simultaneously
        pass
    
    def test_service_failure_and_recovery(self):
        # Test: Complete failure/recovery cycle
        pass
    
    def test_load_distribution_fairness(self):
        # Test: Fair load distribution within services
        pass
```

### **Phase 4: Performance and Stress Tests**

#### **Load Testing**
```python
class TestAPIGatewayPerformance:
    """Performance and stress testing"""
    
    def test_high_request_volume(self):
        # Test: System behavior under high load
        pass
    
    def test_service_capacity_stress(self):
        # Test: Service capacity limit stress testing
        pass
    
    def test_circuit_breaker_under_load(self):
        # Test: Circuit breaker behavior under stress
        pass
```

## üîß **Implementation Plan**

### **Phase 1: Core API Gateway Implementation**

#### **1. Service Registry Component**
```python
class ServiceRegistry:
    """Manages service discovery and health tracking"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.services = {}  # service_id -> ServiceState
        self.service_loads = {}  # service_id -> current_load
        self.failure_counts = {}  # service_id -> failure_count
    
    def register_service(self, service_id: str, initial_state: str = "UNKNOWN"):
        """Register a new service with initial state"""
        pass
    
    def update_service_health(self, service_id: str, new_state: str):
        """Update service health state"""
        pass
    
    def is_service_available(self, service_id: str) -> bool:
        """Check if service is available for routing (TLA+ ServiceAvailable)"""
        pass
```

#### **2. Circuit Breaker Component**
```python
class CircuitBreaker:
    """Implements circuit breaker pattern for service resilience"""
    
    def __init__(self, service_id: str, failure_threshold: int = 2):
        self.service_id = service_id
        self.state = "CLOSED"  # CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN
        self.failure_threshold = failure_threshold
        self.failure_count = 0
    
    def call_service(self, request):
        """Execute service call with circuit breaker protection"""
        pass
    
    def record_success(self):
        """Record successful service call"""
        pass
    
    def record_failure(self):
        """Record failed service call and update circuit state"""
        pass
```

#### **3. Request Router Component**
```python
class RequestRouter:
    """Routes requests to target services following TLA+ specification"""
    
    def __init__(self, service_registry: ServiceRegistry, 
                 circuit_breakers: Dict[str, CircuitBreaker]):
        self.service_registry = service_registry
        self.circuit_breakers = circuit_breakers
        self.request_queue = []
        self.active_requests = set()
    
    def receive_request(self, request: Dict) -> bool:
        """Receive request from client (TLA+ ReceiveRequest)"""
        pass
    
    def route_request(self) -> bool:
        """Route pending request to target service (TLA+ RouteRequest)"""
        pass
    
    def complete_request(self, request_id: str, success: bool):
        """Complete request processing (TLA+ CompleteRequest/FailRequest)"""
        pass
```

#### **4. API Gateway Main Component**
```python
class APIGateway:
    """Main API Gateway coordinating all components"""
    
    def __init__(self, max_requests: int = 100, max_service_load: int = 10):
        self.service_registry = ServiceRegistry()
        self.circuit_breakers = {}
        self.request_router = RequestRouter(self.service_registry, self.circuit_breakers)
        self.max_requests = max_requests
        self.max_service_load = max_service_load
    
    async def handle_request(self, request: Dict) -> Dict:
        """Main request handling entry point"""
        pass
    
    def add_service(self, service_id: str, endpoint: str):
        """Add new service to gateway"""
        pass
    
    def remove_service(self, service_id: str):
        """Remove service from gateway"""
        pass
```

### **Phase 2: TLA+ Property Enforcement**

#### **Property Validation Decorators**
```python
def enforce_target_service_routing(func):
    """Decorator to ensure requests only go to intended target service"""
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # Validate that routing respects target service
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        # Post-condition checks
        return result
    return wrapper

def enforce_circuit_breaker_consistency(func):
    """Decorator to ensure circuit breaker state consistency"""
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # Pre-condition checks
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        # Post-condition validation
        return result
    return wrapper
```

### **Phase 3: Configuration and Deployment**

#### **Configuration Management**
```yaml
# api_gateway_config.yaml
api_gateway:
  max_requests: 1000
  max_service_load: 50
  circuit_breaker:
    failure_threshold: 3
    recovery_timeout: 30
  
services:
  - id: "user_service"
    endpoint: "http://user-service:8080"
    health_check: "/health"
  - id: "data_service" 
    endpoint: "http://data-service:8080"
    health_check: "/health"
```
