# Feature: API Gateway Service Communication
*Formal specification and implementation of the ALIMS API Gateway with service routing, load balancing, and circuit breaker patterns*

## 🎯 Feature Overview

### Problem Statement
The ALIMS system requires a robust API Gateway that can:
1. Route client requests to appropriate backend services
2. Handle service discovery and load balancing
3. Implement circuit breaker patterns for resilience
4. Manage authentication and rate limiting
5. Ensure request/response consistency under concurrent load

### Critical Properties
- **Safety**: No request is routed to a failed service
- **Liveness**: All valid requests eventually receive responses
- **Consistency**: Service discovery reflects actual service states
- **Resilience**: Circuit breakers prevent cascade failures

## 🔍 Scope & Boundaries

### In Scope
- Request routing logic
- Service health monitoring
- Circuit breaker state management
- Load balancing algorithms
- Service discovery mechanisms

### Out of Scope
- Authentication implementation details
- Specific HTTP protocol handling
- Network-level failures
- Service implementation details

## 📊 State Variables

### Primary State
- `services`: Map of service_id → service_status
- `circuit_breakers`: Map of service_id → circuit_state
- `request_queue`: Queue of pending requests
- `service_loads`: Map of service_id → current_load

### Service States
- `HEALTHY`: Service is operational
- `DEGRADED`: Service responding slowly
- `FAILED`: Service not responding
- `UNKNOWN`: Service state not determined

### Circuit Breaker States
- `CLOSED`: Normal operation, requests pass through
- `OPEN`: Circuit tripped, requests fail fast
- `HALF_OPEN`: Testing if service recovered

## 🔄 System Actions

### Core Operations
1. **RouteRequest**: Route incoming request to healthy service
2. **UpdateServiceHealth**: Update service health status
3. **TripCircuitBreaker**: Open circuit when failures exceed threshold
4. **TestService**: Probe service in half-open state
5. **LoadBalance**: Distribute requests among healthy services

### Failure Scenarios
1. Service becomes unavailable
2. Service responds with errors
3. Service response times exceed threshold
4. Multiple concurrent service failures

## 🛡️ Safety Properties

### Invariants
1. **No routing to failed services**: `∀ req ∈ routed_requests : services[req.target] ≠ FAILED`
2. **Circuit breaker consistency**: Open circuits don't route requests
3. **Load balancing fairness**: No service overloaded while others idle
4. **Service discovery accuracy**: Service states reflect reality

### Temporal Properties
1. **Eventually consistent service discovery**: Service states converge to reality
2. **Circuit breaker recovery**: Open circuits eventually test for recovery
3. **Request completion**: All valid requests eventually complete

## 🎭 Liveness Properties

1. **Progress**: System continues processing requests despite service failures
2. **Recovery**: Failed services can be reintegrated when healthy
3. **Availability**: At least one service remains available for critical operations

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### Normal Operation
- Route requests to healthy services
- Load balance across multiple instances
- Monitor service health continuously

### Failure Cases
- Single service failure
- Multiple service failures
- Service recovery scenarios
- Circuit breaker operation

### Edge Cases
- All services fail simultaneously
- Service flapping (rapid fail/recover cycles)
- High concurrent load during failures

## 🔗 Dependencies

### External Systems
- Backend services (predicate-logic-engine, data-service, etc.)
- Service discovery mechanism
- Health check endpoints
- Metrics collection system

### Internal Components
