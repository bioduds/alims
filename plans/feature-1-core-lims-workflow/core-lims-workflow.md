# Core LIMS Workflow Implementation Plan

## 🎯 Feature: Core Laboratory Sample Workflow

### Overview
Implement the fundamental sample processing workflow for ALIMS using PydanticAI agents orchestrated by LangGraph state machines. This forms the backbone of all laboratory operations.

### Scope
- Sample reception and accessioning
- Test assignment and scheduling
- Instrument integration and result capture
- Quality control validation
- Report generation and delivery

## 🔬 Workflow Specification

### Sample States
```
RECEIVED → ACCESSIONED → SCHEDULED → TESTING → QC_PENDING → QC_APPROVED → REPORTED → ARCHIVED
```

### Transitions
1. **RECEIVED → ACCESSIONED**: Sample registration and barcode assignment
2. **ACCESSIONED → SCHEDULED**: Test ordering and instrument scheduling
3. **SCHEDULED → TESTING**: Instrument processing initiation
4. **TESTING → QC_PENDING**: Result capture and initial validation
5. **QC_PENDING → QC_APPROVED**: Quality control verification
6. **QC_APPROVED → REPORTED**: Report generation and delivery
7. **REPORTED → ARCHIVED**: Long-term storage and retention

### Invariants
- Every sample must have a unique identifier
- Chain of custody must be maintained throughout
- All state transitions must be auditable
- Quality control must be performed before reporting
- Data integrity must be preserved at all times

## 🤖 Agent Responsibilities

### Sample Management Agent
- Generate unique sample identifiers
- Maintain chain of custody records
- Track sample location and status
- Handle aliquot management

### Workflow Orchestration Agent
- Determine optimal test scheduling
- Coordinate between instruments
- Manage resource allocation
- Handle exception scenarios

### Quality Control Agent
- Validate test results against reference ranges
- Detect statistical outliers
- Flag potential issues for review
- Approve or reject results

## 📊 Success Metrics
- 100% sample traceability
- Zero data integrity violations
- < 2% manual intervention rate
- Full regulatory compliance
- Average turnaround time reduction of 20%

## 🛠️ Implementation Steps
1. Write TLA+ specification for workflow states and transitions
2. Validate specification with TLC model checker
3. Implement Pydantic models for sample and workflow data
4. Develop PydanticAI agents for each workflow component
5. Create LangGraph workflow orchestration
6. Integrate with existing ALIMS infrastructure
7. Comprehensive testing and validation

## 🔍 Quality Assurance
- Unit tests for each agent component
- Integration tests for workflow transitions
- Performance testing under load
- Compliance validation against laboratory standards
- User acceptance testing with laboratory staff

This implementation will establish ALIMS as a formally verified, AI-driven laboratory information management system.
