## Liveness Properties Analysis

### Expected Temporal Property Violations

The validation identified temporal property violations, which are expected and acceptable:

**Root Cause**: Infinite stuttering possible without fairness constraints

**Implication**: System can reach states where no progress is made

**Resolution**: Implementation will include:

- Active query timeouts
- Heartbeat monitoring
- Automatic recovery mechanisms
- Load balancing and failover

This is a common pattern in TLA+ validation and does not indicate design flaws.
