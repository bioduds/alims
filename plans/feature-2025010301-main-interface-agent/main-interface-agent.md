# Main Interface Agent with Prolog-Style Logical Reasoning

## Feature Overview

This feature integrates Prolog-style logical reasoning capabilities into the Main Interface Agent for Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS). The agent will be able to:

1. Perform logical inference over laboratory data and rules
2. Automatically derive new knowledge from existing facts
3. Validate laboratory procedures against defined constraints
4. Optimize resource allocation using logical programming
5. Handle complex queries requiring multi-step reasoning
6. Maintain knowledge base consistency and evolution

## Architectural Design

### Core Components

1. **Knowledge Base Manager**: Stores facts, rules, and constraints in Prolog format
2. **Inference Engine**: Performs unification, backtracking, and resolution
3. **Query Processor**: Handles complex logical queries from users and systems
4. **Rule Validator**: Ensures consistency and prevents logical contradictions
5. **Integration Layer**: Connects Prolog reasoning with existing LIMS operations

### Key Features

1. **Dynamic Rule Management**: Add, modify, and remove rules during runtime
2. **Fact Learning**: Automatically extract facts from laboratory operations
3. **Constraint Checking**: Validate all operations against logical constraints
4. **Query Optimization**: Efficient query execution with caching and indexing
5. **Explanation Generation**: Provide reasoning traces for all conclusions

## Implementation Requirements

### State Variables

- Knowledge base (facts and rules)
- Active queries and their resolution states
- Inference chains and backtracking stacks
- Performance metrics and optimization data
- User sessions and query contexts

### Safety Properties

- Knowledge base consistency (no contradictions)
- Query termination (no infinite loops)
- Data integrity during concurrent access
- Rule validation before addition

### Liveness Properties

- All valid queries eventually receive responses
- Knowledge base updates are eventually propagated
- Performance optimization eventually improves response times
- System remains responsive under load

## Success Criteria

1. TLA+ specification validates all safety and liveness properties
2. Implementation passes comprehensive test suite
3. Integration with existing LIMS is seamless
4. Performance meets or exceeds baseline requirements
5. User acceptance testing confirms usability improvements

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Complexity Management**: Use incremental development with continuous validation
2. **Performance**: Implement caching and query optimization from the start
3. **Integration**: Maintain backward compatibility with existing interfaces
4. **Training**: Provide comprehensive documentation and examples

## Timeline

1. Week 1: TLA+ specification and validation
2. Week 2: Core Prolog engine implementation
3. Week 3: Integration with Main Interface Agent
4. Week 4: Testing, optimization, and documentation
