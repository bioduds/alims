# Service Health Monitoring Implementation Plan

## Feature Overview

**Feature ID**: 20250709-service-health-monitoring
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Complexity**: MEDIUM
**Impact**: CRITICAL

## Problem Statement

Currently, the ALIMS system has unhealthy services that prevent proper system operation:
- API Gateway: UNHEALTHY (health checks failing)
- Workflow Manager: UNHEALTHY (service communication issues)

This prevents reliable service-to-service communication and system stability.

## Solution Design

Implement a formal Service Health Monitoring system with TLA+ verified state transitions that ensures:

1. **Reliable Health Detection** - Services accurately report their health status
2. **State Consistency** - Health states are well-defined and consistent across the system
3. **Fault Tolerance** - System gracefully handles service failures and recoveries
4. **Service Discovery** - Services can find and communicate with healthy services

## TLA+ Specification Requirements

### State Variables
- `services`: Set of all services in the system
- `health_status`: Function mapping services to health states
- `discovery_registry`: Service discovery information
- `health_checks`: Ongoing health check operations

### Health States
- `UNKNOWN`: Initial state, health not yet determined
- `STARTING`: Service is initializing
- `HEALTHY`: Service is operational and responding
- `DEGRADED`: Service is operational but experiencing issues
- `UNHEALTHY`: Service is not responding or failing health checks
- `STOPPING`: Service is shutting down gracefully
- `STOPPED`: Service has stopped

### Safety Properties
1. **StateConsistency**: Health states are always well-defined
2. **MonotonicTransitions**: Certain transitions are irreversible (e.g., STOPPED)
3. **HealthCheckValidity**: Health checks accurately reflect service state
4. **DiscoveryConsistency**: Service registry matches actual service states

### Liveness Properties
1. **EventualHealthDetermination**: All services eventually have known health status
2. **FailureDetection**: Unhealthy services are eventually detected
3. **RecoveryDetection**: Recovered services are eventually marked as healthy

## Implementation Components

### Core Components
1. **HealthMonitor**: Central health monitoring service
2. **HealthChecker**: Individual service health check logic
3. **ServiceRegistry**: Service discovery and registration
4. **HealthReporter**: Health status reporting and aggregation

### API Endpoints
- `GET /health` - Individual service health endpoint
- `GET /health/status` - Service health status
- `POST /health/register` - Service registration
- `DELETE /health/unregister` - Service unregistration
- `GET /discovery/services` - Available services list

### Integration Points
- Docker health checks configuration
- Service-to-service communication
- Load balancer health check integration
- Monitoring system integration

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
1. All services report accurate health status
2. Service discovery correctly identifies healthy services
3. Failed services are automatically detected and marked unhealthy
4. Recovered services are automatically detected and marked healthy
5. Health check endpoints respond within acceptable timeframes (<5s)

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. Health check overhead < 1% of service resources
2. Health status updates propagate within 30 seconds
3. System remains stable under service failure scenarios
4. 99.9% accuracy in health status reporting

### TLA+ Verification Requirements
1. All safety properties verified with TLC model checker
2. Liveness properties verified under fair scheduling
3. No deadlock scenarios in health check operations
4. State space exploration covers all transition combinations

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Health state transition logic
- Individual health check implementations
- Service registry operations
- Error handling scenarios

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end health monitoring workflow
- Service discovery under failure conditions
- Multi-service health status coordination
- Docker container health integration

### Property-Based Tests
- TLA+ property validation in code
- Invariant checking during operations
- Stress testing under concurrent load
- Failure injection testing

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: TLA+ Specification (Days 1-2)
1. Create formal TLA+ specification
2. Define state variables and transitions
3. Specify safety and liveness properties
4. Validate with TLC model checker

### Phase 2: Core Implementation (Days 3-4)
1. Implement HealthMonitor service
2. Add health check endpoints to all services
3. Create ServiceRegistry implementation
4. Add Docker health check configuration

### Phase 3: Integration & Testing (Days 5-6)
1. Integrate with existing services
2. Add comprehensive test suite
3. Validate TLA+ properties in tests
4. Performance testing and optimization

### Phase 4: Deployment & Validation (Day 7)
1. Deploy to development environment
2. Validate all services report healthy
3. Test failure and recovery scenarios
4. Document operational procedures

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- All services report HEALTHY status consistently
- Health check response time < 1 second (95th percentile)
- Service discovery accuracy > 99.9%
- Zero false positive/negative health reports

### System Metrics
- System uptime improvement > 95%
- Service-to-service communication success rate > 99%
- Mean time to detect failure < 30 seconds
- Mean time to detect recovery < 30 seconds

### TLA+ Verification Metrics
- All safety properties verified (100%)
- All liveness properties verified (100%)
- State space exploration > 100,000 states
- Zero property violations found

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Performance Impact**: Minimize health check overhead through efficient implementation
2. **False Positives**: Implement sophisticated health check logic with multiple validation points
3. **Network Partitions**: Design health checks to handle network failure scenarios
4. **State Synchronization**: Use eventual consistency for health status propagation

### Implementation Risks
1. **Complexity**: Start with simple health checks and incrementally add sophistication
2. **Integration**: Thoroughly test integration with existing services
3. **Deployment**: Use phased rollout with rollback capability
4. **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive logging and alerting

## Next Steps

1. **Create TLA+ Specification** - Following tla.md workflow
2. **TLC Model Checking** - Validate all properties
3. **Human Approval** - Review specification with stakeholder
4. **Implementation** - Build according to verified specification
5. **Testing** - Validate TLA+ properties in code
6. **Deployment** - Roll out to development environment

## TLA+ Validation Status

**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED - SPECIFICATION APPROVED**

The TLA+ specification for Service Health Monitoring has been successfully validated:

- **TLC Model Checker**: Passed with 483+ million states explored
- **Safety Properties**: All invariants verified (no violations found)
- **Specification File**: `tla/ServiceHealthMonitoring.tla`
- **Validation Summary**: `tla/TLA_VALIDATION_SUMMARY.md`

Key validated properties:
- State consistency and valid transitions
- Automatic service discovery registration/deregistration
- Health check bounds and resource management
- Failure detection with 3-failure threshold
- Terminal state immutability

The specification is **ready for implementation**.

This feature addresses the critical production blocker of unhealthy services and establishes the foundation for reliable service communication across the ALIMS system.
