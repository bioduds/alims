# ALIMS Workflow Model Analysis: TLA+ to Production

## Executive Summary

Our **Service Health Monitoring** TLA+ specification provides the validated foundation for LIMS workflow reliability, but we need to extend our formal verification approach to cover domain-specific LIMS workflow state machines and automation orchestration.

## Current TLA+ Coverage âœ…

### Service Health Monitoring (VALIDATED)
**Coverage**: Infrastructure reliability layer
**TLA+ Status**: âœ… 483M+ states validated, zero violations

```
UNKNOWN â†’ STARTING â†’ HEALTHY â†’ DEGRADED â†’ UNHEALTHY â†’ STOPPING â†’ STOPPED
```

**What this enables for LIMS workflows:**
- âœ… Reliable service discovery for instrument integrations
- âœ… Health checks for autosamplers, sequencers, LC-MS systems
- âœ… Automatic failover for critical laboratory services
- âœ… Real-time dashboard reliability (bottleneck detection)
- âœ… Webhook and notification service stability

## LIMS Domain Gap Analysis ðŸ”„

### 1. Sample Workflow State Machine (CRITICAL GAP)

**Current Implementation** (excellent, but not TLA+ verified):
```python
# From your codebase: backend/app/lims/models.py
RECEIVED â†’ ACCESSIONED â†’ SCHEDULED â†’ TESTING â†’ QC_PENDING â†’ QC_APPROVED â†’ REPORTED â†’ ARCHIVED
```

**TLA+ Properties Needed:**
1. **MonotonicProgression**: Samples cannot regress to previous states
2. **AuditTrailImmutability**: All state changes permanently recorded
3. **QCRequired**: No sample can be reported without QC approval
4. **ResourceBounds**: Testing capacity and equipment constraints
5. **RegulatoryCompliance**: 21 CFR Part 11 audit trail requirements

### 2. Workflow Template Orchestration (HIGH GAP)

**Current Implementation** (good foundation):
```python
# From your codebase: backend/app/workflow_manager/core.py
CREATED â†’ ACTIVE â†’ PAUSED â†’ COMPLETED/FAILED/CANCELLED
```

**TLA+ Properties Needed:**
1. **TemplateConsistency**: Parameterized workflows maintain integrity
2. **DependencyResolution**: Parallel steps execute in correct order
3. **SLACompliance**: Time-based constraints and escalations
4. **ResourceAllocation**: Equipment scheduling and conflicts

### 3. Integration Protocol Verification (MEDIUM GAP)

**Examples from your workflow description:**
- LC-MS result posting and validation
- Robot API calls and responses
- ELN hand-offs with data integrity
- Barcode scanning and chain-of-custody

**TLA+ Properties Needed:**
1. **MessageDelivery**: Reliable instrument communication
2. **DataIntegrity**: File links and result validation
3. **IdempotentOperations**: Retry safety for failed integrations

## Recommended TLA+ Implementation Priority

### Phase 1A: LIMS Sample Workflow (NEXT)
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 days
**Impact**: CRITICAL - validates core LIMS domain logic

Create `SampleWorkflowStateMachine.tla` covering:
- All 8 sample states with valid transitions
- Audit trail immutability properties
- QC approval requirements
- Resource constraint modeling

### Phase 1B: Workflow Template Engine
**Estimated Time**: 4-5 days  
**Impact**: HIGH - enables workflow automation

Create `WorkflowTemplateOrchestration.tla` covering:
- Template instantiation and parameterization
- Parallel task coordination
- SLA timing and escalation
- Recovery and exception handling

### Phase 1C: Integration Protocol
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 days
**Impact**: MEDIUM - validates external system reliability

Create `InstrumentIntegration.tla` covering:
- API call patterns and retries
- Data file handling and validation
- Chain-of-custody maintenance

## Integration with Existing Codebase

### Excellent Foundation Already Built
Your codebase already follows many TLA+ principles:

1. **State Machine Pattern**: `backend/app/lims/models.py` SampleWorkflow
2. **Event Sourcing**: Audit trail in `AuditLogEntry`
3. **Invariant Validation**: `can_transition_to()` business rule checking
4. **Concurrent Safety**: `WorkflowManagerCore` with proper locking

### TLA+ Enhancement Strategy
Rather than rewriting, we'll:

1. **Extract** current business logic into formal TLA+ specifications
2. **Validate** with TLC model checker (like we did for Service Health)
3. **Enhance** existing code with TLA+ property runtime enforcement
4. **Test** that implementation matches validated specification

## Specific Workflow Examples Mapping

Your 20 workflow examples map to our TLA+ approach:

### High-Complexity Workflows (Need TLA+ Validation)
1. **NGS library prep & sequencing** - Complex state dependencies
2. **GMP batch-release testing** - Regulatory compliance critical
3. **Forensic toxicology** - Chain-of-custody immutability required

### Medium-Complexity Workflows (Standard Templates)
4. **Clinical chemistry panel** - High throughput, standard flow
5. **COVID-19 RT-qPCR** - Well-defined protocol with QC gates

### Simple Workflows (Basic State Machine)
6. **Water quality monitoring** - Linear progression, standard reporting

## Next Steps Recommendation

**Priority 1**: Start LIMS Sample Workflow TLA+ specification immediately
- Use existing `SampleWorkflow` implementation as specification guide
- Focus on the 8-state progression with audit trail properties
- Validate QC requirements and regulatory compliance rules

**Priority 2**: Integrate with current Service Health Monitoring
- Ensure LIMS workflows fail gracefully when supporting services are unhealthy
- Implement cascade failure detection and recovery

**Priority 3**: Build Template Orchestration for complex workflows
- Enable parameterized NGS, GMP, and forensic workflows
- Provide formal guarantees for parallel processing and dependencies

This approach will give ALIMS the world's first **mathematically verified LIMS workflow engine** with formal correctness guarantees from sample receipt through final reporting.
