# Tensor-Based Calendar System for ALIMS - TLA+ Feature Plan

## 🧮 Executive Summary

This feature implements a revolutionary **tensor-based temporal calendar system** that models all time-dependent LIMS operations as multi-dimensional tensor operations. This approach provides unprecedented optimization, prediction, and automation capabilities for laboratory scheduling, resource allocation, and workflow coordination.

## 🎯 Vision: Why Tensors for Laboratory Calendars?

### **The Tensor Advantage**
Laboratory operations involve complex multi-dimensional temporal relationships:
- **Sample timelines** (collection → analysis → reporting)
- **Resource schedules** (instruments, technicians, reagents)
- **Workflow dependencies** (sequential and parallel processes)
- **Regulatory deadlines** (TAT requirements, stability studies)
- **Capacity constraints** (equipment availability, staff shifts)

Traditional calendar systems treat these as separate, disconnected events. **Tensors model these as interconnected dimensions**, enabling:

1. **Mathematical Optimization**: Linear algebra operations for optimal scheduling
2. **Predictive Analytics**: Pattern recognition across time dimensions
3. **Real-time Adaptation**: Dynamic rescheduling based on constraints
4. **Resource Efficiency**: Optimal utilization through tensor decomposition
5. **Compliance Automation**: Automatic deadline tracking and enforcement

## 🏗️ Tensor Calendar Architecture

### **Core Tensor Dimensions**

```
LIMS_Calendar_Tensor[sample, resource, time, workflow, constraint]
```

Where each dimension represents:
- **sample**: Sample ID, type, priority, requirements
- **resource**: Equipment, technician, reagent, space
- **time**: Absolute time, relative time, duration, deadlines
- **workflow**: Workflow stage, dependencies, prerequisites
- **constraint**: Regulatory, capacity, priority, availability

### **Tensor Operations for LIMS**

1. **Schedule Optimization**: Matrix multiplication for resource allocation
2. **Conflict Detection**: Tensor dot products identify scheduling conflicts
3. **Capacity Planning**: Tensor decomposition reveals bottlenecks
4. **Predictive Scheduling**: Neural tensor networks predict delays
